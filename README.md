In the second episode of commit.js we'll talk about the idea lit-html, a library for template management and we will refactor the app that we've developed to use it. Later in the episode we will include typescript and create a build process for our application.

In the next couple of series we will be developing our own Angular like library that will speed up our development process. 

The event will be broadcasted on youtube:
